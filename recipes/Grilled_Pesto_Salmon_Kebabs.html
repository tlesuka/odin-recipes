        Next time you fire up your grill, whip up these summery salmon kebabs with a pesto that 
        won`t break the calorie bank. Eliminating pine nuts from the pesto certainly doesn`t 
        minimize the flavor, particularly when spread across heart-healthy salmon, which is packed
        with omega-3s. If you have leftover pesto, use it within a day or two, on top of pasta, 
        sandwiches and burgers. It`s too good to pass up. This recipe works well substituting 
        shrimp or swordfish as main ingredient, too.

            <li>1/2 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>

        For Skewers

                until a smooth paste forms. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>

                and add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Place the skewers over a medium-high grill. Grill for 1 minute on each side, until
