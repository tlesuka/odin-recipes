        Peanuts, sesame and ginger combined with whole-wheat noodles create a savory Asian-inspired 
        dish full of flavor. We make peace with the carbs by using a healthy equation of one-third 
        vegetables, one-third lean protein and one-third whole wheat pasta.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound whole-wheat spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark sesame oil</li>
            <li>3/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips or cubes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons creamy, unsalted peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame tahini</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup snow peas, strings removed</li>
            <li>1 large zucchini, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 scallions, sliced thin crosswise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the pasta; cook until al dente, about 
                8-10 minutes. Reserve Â¼ cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta in a 
                colander. Rinse under cold running water for a couple minutes to chill the noodles
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook,
                stirring often, until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer the 
                chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir 
                in the peanut butter, tahini, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, red pepper flakes and 
                reserved pasta water; cook until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell 
                pepper, snow peas and zucchini; cook until tender, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in the 
                cooked chicken and drained noodles and serve sprinkled with scallions and sesame 
                seeds.</li>
        </ol>
