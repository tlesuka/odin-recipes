    <p> Once the ultimate energy food for ancient Mayans and Aztecs, <strong>chia seeds</strong> are an excellent source of antioxidants, 
        omega-3s, calcium and fiber. Plus, they absorb over 10 times their weight in water, which makes them an unlikely 
        hydration source too. In this recipe, chia seeds are soaked in almond milk, which transforms them into a 
        luxurious and creamy tapioca-like pudding. Top this easy-to-make chia pudding with some fresh seasonal fruit, 
        and you have yourself an incredibly nourishing breakfast.
